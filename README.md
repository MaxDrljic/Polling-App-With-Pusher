# Polling-App-With-Pusher

Simple voting app which uses NodeJS, MongoDB / mLab with Pusher and some other minor packages. On the front-end, we have vanilla JavaScript and HTML 5. This app allows you to choose and vote between popular operating systems, such as Windows and Linux. CanvasJS is used to make graphical representation on the voting pool.

There are some minor configurations you have to make in order to use this app properly, keys.js should be set with the necessary values. To get those values, you need an account on mLab and Pusher, so be sure to set there everything up to get access to data which you need.

Enjoy!
